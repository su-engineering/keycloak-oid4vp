# OID4VP Request Flow — Code Walkthrough

This document traces the OID4VP authorization request through the code for both same-device and cross-device flows. Start with [the diagrams](diagrams.md) for an overview. Security properties described here are implementation behavior, not a completed security audit; see [known limitations](enterprise-readiness.md).

## Key Concepts

### The `request_handle`

The `request_handle` is a unique, unguessable token generated once for each enabled device flow when a login page is rendered. It is the stable handle for the browser-side login attempt.

1. **Flow lookup** — maps the browser flow back to the stored flow context `{rootSessionId, tabId, effectiveClientId, responseUri, flow}`.
2. **Completion handle** — identifies which deferred authentication result `/complete-auth` should consume after a successful wallet callback.

**Format:** Random UUID. Generated when the login page is rendered, before any wallet fetches the request object.

**Lifecycle:** Generated during login page rendering → embedded in the `request_uri` path and, for cross-device, in the status polling URL → reused across multiple request-object fetches for the same browser flow → removed after the first successful callback consumes the flow.

**Security note:** The `request_handle` is not enough on its own to observe or finish the flow. Both `/cross-device/status` and `/complete-auth` use the stored `{rootSessionId, tabId}` from the single-use store to recover the original Keycloak authentication session and require the current browser request to be attached to that same auth session. In practice, security relies on both: a live one-time handle and the matching browser auth-session cookie.

### The `state` Parameter

The `state` parameter is a unique, unguessable token generated per created request object. It serves two purposes:

1. **Callback integrity** — the verifier checks that the `state` returned by the wallet matches the stored request context for that request object, preventing the callback from being rebound to a different request instance.
2. **Request binding** — maps the wallet's direct_post response back to the exact created request instance, especially important when the same `request_uri` is fetched multiple times before one callback arrives.

**Format:** `{tabId}.{random}` where `tabId` is Keycloak's auth session tab identifier and `random` is a fresh UUID-like random value. Generated when `/request-object/{requestHandle}` is fetched.

**Lifecycle:** Generated when the wallet fetches a request object → included in the signed request object JWT → returned by the wallet in the direct_post `state` form parameter → resolved back to a stored request context → discarded after TTL or after the flow is consumed.

**Security note:** The `state` value itself is not a secret — it is transmitted in signed request objects and form parameters. The flow's security does not rely on `state` being confidential. Instead, integrity is ensured by other layers: the request object is **signed** (preventing tampering with `state`, `nonce`, `response_uri`, and other claims), and when HAIP is enabled the wallet response is **encrypted** (protecting `vp_token` and `state` in transit). The `nonce` in the request object provides replay protection, and the KB-JWT (SD-JWT) / device authentication (mDoc) binds the presentation to the specific transaction.

**Difference from `request_handle`:** `request_handle` is stable for one browser flow and is used to recover or complete that flow later. `state` is per fetched request object and binds the wallet callback to one specific created request instance under that flow.

## Entry Point: Login Page

When a user clicks "Login with Wallet", Keycloak calls:

```
Oid4vpIdentityProvider.performLogin(AuthenticationRequest)
```

This method:

1. **Initializes login context** (`initializeLoginContext`) — computes `clientId` / `effectiveClientId`, chooses the auth-session tab ID used for flow binding, and captures the browser routing parameters needed to build the fallback form action
2. **Builds redirect flow data** (`buildRedirectFlowData`) — creates a separate stable `requestHandle` for each enabled flow (same-device and cross-device), stores the per-flow context in `Oid4vpRequestObjectStore`, builds the corresponding `request_uri` URLs
3. **Renders the login page** (`buildLoginFormResponse`) — passes wallet URLs, QR code, status URL, and poll interval to `login-oid4vp-idp.ftl`

The login page contains:
- Hidden state/request-handle fields used to keep the browser-side flow bound to the original Keycloak login attempt
- A same-device deep link (`openid4vp://...?client_id=...&request_uri=...`)
- A cross-device QR code encoding a similar URL (`openid4vp://...?client_id=...&request_uri=...`)
- JavaScript that polls `/cross-device/status?request_handle=...` using the cross-device flow's stable request handle when that flow is enabled

**Key detail:** The `request_uri` points to `/endpoint/request-object/{requestHandle}`. The request handle is stable for the browser flow, but each request-object fetch creates a fresh request context with its own `state`, `nonce`, and response-encryption key when the effective `response_mode` is `direct_post.jwt`. The request object JWT itself expires quickly (default 10 seconds) to limit fetch/replay windows, but once a wallet has fetched it, the later callback is accepted as long as the stored request context and authentication session still exist.

## Phase 1: Wallet Fetches Request Object

The wallet URL rendered by the login page only advertises `client_id` and `request_uri`, so wallets normally fetch the request object with `GET /request-object/{requestHandle}`. The implementation also accepts `POST /request-object/{requestHandle}` so a wallet can send `wallet_nonce` and/or `wallet_metadata`.

```
Oid4vpIdentityProviderEndpoint.getRequestObject(requestHandle)
    or
Oid4vpIdentityProviderEndpoint.postRequestObject(requestHandle, walletNonce, walletMetadata)
    both call →
Oid4vpRequestObjectService.generateRequestObject(requestHandle, walletNonce, walletMetadata)
```

`generateRequestObject`:

1. Resolves the `requestHandle` → looks up the stored flow context `{rootSessionId, tabId, effectiveClientId, responseUri, flow}` from `Oid4vpRequestObjectStore`
2. Resolves the auth session from `rootSessionId` + `tabId` to ensure the login attempt is still active
3. Creates a fresh request context `{requestHandle, state, nonce, encryptionKeyJson, encryptionJwkThumbprint, flow}` and stores it under the new `state` (and `kid` when the effective `response_mode` is `direct_post.jwt`) before the response is returned to the wallet
4. Delegates to `Oid4vpRedirectFlowService.buildSignedRequestObject(params)` using that fresh request context:

```
Oid4vpRedirectFlowService.buildSignedRequestObject(RequestObjectParams)
```

This method:

1. **Resolves signing and response-encryption keys** — uses the configured x509 signing JWK when present, otherwise the realm signing key; when the effective `response_mode` is `direct_post.jwt`, it also generates or reuses the fresh per-request ECDH-ES response-encryption key
2. **Builds request claims** — `jti`, `iat`, `exp`, `iss`, `aud`, `client_id`, `response_type`, `response_mode`, `response_uri`, `nonce`, `state`, optional `wallet_nonce`, DCQL query, verifier info, and `client_metadata`. When `useIdTokenSubject` is enabled and HAIP is disabled, `response_type` becomes `vp_token id_token` and `scope=openid` is added; under HAIP, `useIdTokenSubject` is effectively disabled
3. **Builds `client_metadata`** — only for encrypted wallet responses: includes the public response-encryption JWK in `jwks`, the verifier's supported wallet-response encryption methods, and `vp_formats_supported`
4. **Normalizes DCQL trusted-authorities constraints** — if `trustedAuthoritiesMode` is enabled, the generated/manual DCQL query gets exactly one `trusted_authorities` type:
   - `etsi_tl` advertises the configured trust-list URL
   - `aki` advertises certificate key identifiers extracted from the configured trust list
   - `none` leaves `trusted_authorities` absent
   HAIP does not force this feature on; it remains explicit verifier configuration.
5. **Delegates compact JWS creation to `Oid4vpRequestObjectSigner`** — attaches `x5c` or public `jwk` headers as required by the chosen client-id scheme and signs through Keycloak key abstractions

Returns `SignedRequestObject(jwt, encryptionKeyJson)`. The returned `encryptionKeyJson` matches the freshly stored request context entry for that specific created request object.

6. **Encrypts if `wallet_metadata` is present** (POST only) — `Oid4vpRequestObjectService` parses the wallet metadata after signing and, when the wallet supplied a request-object encryption key, wraps the signed JWT in a JWE via `Oid4vpRequestObjectEncryptor.encrypt`. The `cty` header is set to `oauth-authz-req+jwt` to indicate a nested JWT. The HTTP content type remains `application/oauth-authz-req+jwt`.

## Phase 2: Wallet Posts VP Token

The wallet verifies the request, prompts the user, and POSTs the VP token.

Both same-device and cross-device wallets POST to the `response_uri`. For `direct_post`, the form body carries `vp_token`, optional `id_token`, and `state`. For `direct_post.jwt`, the form body carries `response=<JWE/JWT>`; the decrypted payload inside that JWT/JWE must contain `state`, and the form body may also include a separate `state` parameter. The endpoint handles both in the same method:

```
Oid4vpIdentityProviderEndpoint.handlePost(state, vpToken, encryptedResponse, error, errorDescription)
```

`handlePost`:

1. **Reads form parameters** — `state`, `vp_token`, `id_token`, `response`, `error`, and `error_description`
2. **KID-based resolution** (encrypted responses only) — whenever the `response` form parameter is present, extracts the KID from the JWE header and resolves the full request context from `Oid4vpRequestObjectStore`
3. **Resolves auth session** from the request context's `{rootSessionId, tabId}`
4. **Decrypts and validates state** (when `response_mode=direct_post.jwt`) — decrypts the JWT/JWE from the `response` form parameter using the request context's stored private key, extracts `vp_token`, `id_token`, `state`, `error`, `error_description`, and `mdocGeneratedNonce`, requires the decrypted `state` to match the stored request context, and also rejects the callback if a separate posted `state` form parameter is present but differs from the decrypted `state`
5. **Error handling** — if the wallet sent an OAuth error (for example `access_denied`), returns a JSON body containing `error` and optional `error_description` without a `redirect_uri`, so the browser can remain on the login page and retry
6. **Derives same-device vs cross-device behavior from the stored request context** — the callback does not trust a `flow` query parameter; it uses the `flow` value anchored behind the resolved request context
7. **Calls `processVpToken`** →

```
processVpToken(authSession, requestContext, state, vpToken, idToken, mdocGeneratedNonce, isCrossDeviceFlow)
```

8. **Verifies the credential** via `Oid4vpCallbackProcessor.process(requestContext, vpToken, idToken, mdocGeneratedNonce)`:

```
Oid4vpCallbackProcessor.process(requestContext, vpToken, idToken, mdocGeneratedNonce)
```

This:
- Validates that a request context was resolved for the callback
- Reads `clientId`, `nonce`, `responseUri`, and `encryptionJwkThumbprint` from that request context
- Reads the request-scoped configured credential types captured when the request object was created
- Passes `mdocGeneratedNonce` from the decrypted callback payload when present
- Calls `VpTokenProcessor.process(vpToken, clientId, nonce, responseUri, mdocGeneratedNonce, encryptionJwkThumbprint)`:
  - SD-JWT: `SdJwtVerifier.verify()` — delegates to Keycloak's `SdJwtVP.verify()` which performs:
    1. **Issuer signature verification** — validates the SD-JWT's JWS signature using the issuer's public key, resolved in this order:
       - when DID resolution is enabled and the issuer is a DID: method allowlist dispatch to `DidWebResolver` or `DidWebVhResolver`; failures reject without certificate/metadata fallback
       - `x5c` certificate-chain validation against the trust list (`X5cChainValidator`)
       - outside HAIP only: JWT VC issuer metadata lookup via `iss` + JOSE `kid` (`JwtVcIssuerMetadataResolver`), including `jwks_uri`
       - final direct trusted-certificate fallback for non-HAIP deployments that use self-signed or directly trusted issuer keys
    2. **Issuer JWT time checks** — `exp` (must not be expired), `nbf` (must be valid now), both with configurable clock skew (default 60s). No `iat` freshness check on the issuer JWT (old credentials are valid as long as `exp` holds)
    3. **Selective disclosure digest verification** — SHA-256 hashes of disclosed claims match the `_sd` digests in the issuer JWT
    4. **KB-JWT signature verification** — verifies the Key Binding JWT signature against the holder's public key from the credential's `cnf.jwk` claim
    5. **KB-JWT claim validation** — `aud` must match `clientId` (falls back to `response_uri` if primary check fails), `nonce` must match the expected nonce from the request object, `iat` must be fresh (default max age 300s + 60s clock skew), `exp`/`nbf` if present
    6. **KB-JWT `sd_hash` validation** — must equal SHA-256 of the unbound SD-JWT presentation (issuer JWT + disclosures, without the KB-JWT itself)
  - mDoc: `MdocVerifier.verifyWithTrustedCerts()` — validates MSO COSE_Sign1 issuer signature, MSO validity period (`validFrom`/`validUntil`), value digest integrity (SHA-256 of IssuerSignedItems vs MSO digests), device authentication signature via SessionTranscript binding, and extracts namespace-prefixed claims. The device authentication supports two SessionTranscript formats:
    - **OID4VP 1.0** (Appendix B.3.2.2): `[null, null, ["OpenID4VPHandover", SHA-256(CBOR([client_id, nonce, jwk_thumbprint, response_uri]))]]` — the `jwk_thumbprint` is the RFC 7638 SHA-256 thumbprint of the HAIP encryption key from `client_metadata.jwks`, stored in the request context when the request object is created
    - **ISO 18013-7** (Annex B.4.4): `[null, null, [SHA-256(CBOR([client_id, mdoc_generated_nonce])), SHA-256(CBOR([response_uri, mdoc_generated_nonce])), nonce]]` — used as a fallback when `mdocGeneratedNonce` is present (extracted from JWE `apu` header) and the OID4VP 1.0 transcript does not verify
  - Checks revocation via `StatusListVerifier`
  - Validates the fetched trust list's `LoTEType` against the IdP's configured trust domain
- Verifies every returned presentation and checks it against its own ID in the DCQL snapshot saved with the request (format, type metadata, claim paths, exact values and required sets)
- Applies the issuer allow-list to every SD-JWT credential, and retains credentials separately for mapping
- Chooses the identity using `identityCredentialId`, or the first returned query in request order; rejects ambiguous credential-based identities
- Maps claims to `BrokeredIdentityContext`

9. **Stores deferred auth and returns redirect** — calls:

```
directPostService.storeAndSignal(authSession, requestHandle, context, isCrossDeviceFlow)
```

### Same-Device vs Cross-Device Differences

Both flows go through `Oid4vpDirectPostService.storeAndSignal`, which:

1. Serializes the `BrokeredIdentityContext` into the auth session (`DEFERRED_IDENTITY_NOTE`)
2. Also stores claims JSON separately (`DEFERRED_CLAIMS_NOTE`) because Keycloak's serializer loses nested Map types
3. Stores the deferred auth single-use object for both flows using the realm login timeout and, for cross-device only, stores a separate completion marker using `crossDeviceCompleteTtlSeconds`:
   - `oid4vp_deferred:{requestHandle}` → `{rootSessionId, tabId}` — used by `/complete-auth`
   - `oid4vp_complete:{requestHandle}` → `{completeAuthUrl}` — read by status polling until `/complete-auth` removes it
4. Removes the stable `requestHandle` entry. That flow-handle entry is the authoritative liveness check for all later `state` / `kid` lookups, so any leftover request-specific entries are rejected and lazily removed on access, which invalidates every outstanding request context for that flow and blocks replay after the first successful callback

The difference is in the response:

- **Same-device:** Returns `{"redirect_uri": "/complete-auth?request_handle=..."}`. The wallet opens this URL in the browser, which triggers `completeAuth`.
- **Cross-device:** Returns `200 OK` with `{}` body. The browser's next status poll picks up the completion signal and navigates to `/complete-auth`.

### Completion: `/complete-auth`

Both flows converge at:

```
Oid4vpIdentityProviderEndpoint.completeAuth(requestHandle)
    → Oid4vpDirectPostService.completeAuth(requestHandle, callback, event)
```

`completeAuth`:

1. Reads `oid4vp_deferred:{requestHandle}` without consuming it yet → gets `{rootSessionId, tabId}`
2. Resolves the stored auth session from `rootSessionId` + `tabId`
3. Resolves the current browser auth session from Keycloak's auth-session cookie and requires it to match the stored session
4. Consumes `oid4vp_deferred:{requestHandle}` and the cross-device completion marker
5. Deserializes the `BrokeredIdentityContext` from `DEFERRED_IDENTITY_NOTE`
6. Restores claims from `DEFERRED_CLAIMS_NOTE`
7. Calls `callback.authenticated(context)` — Keycloak completes the login

### Cross-Device: Browser Status Polling

Meanwhile, the login page polls for the result:

```
GET /cross-device/status?request_handle=...
Oid4vpIdentityProviderEndpoint.crossDeviceStatus(requestHandle)
    → Oid4vpDirectPostService.resolveCrossDeviceCompleteAuthUrl(requestHandle)
```

Each poll resolves the auth session for the `requestHandle` and requires the current browser auth-session cookie to match it; otherwise it returns `204 No Content` and the page stops polling. When they match, it reads `oid4vp_complete:{requestHandle}` from `singleUseObjects`:
- Not present: `{"status": "pending"}`
- Present: `{"status": "complete", "redirect_uri": "/complete-auth?request_handle=..."}`, leaving the marker in place until `/complete-auth` consumes it

The page navigates to `redirect_uri`, triggering the completion flow above. Responses carry `Cache-Control: no-store`.

Each poll is an ordinary request that finishes within its own Keycloak session and transaction. No connection, thread, or Keycloak session is held open between polls, and any node with access to the shared single-use store can answer.

## Error Handling

Errors can occur at multiple points:

- **Wallet-side errors** (user denied consent, credential not available): The wallet may not POST to the verifier at all, or it may POST an OAuth error. In both cases the endpoint returns a plain JSON error body without `redirect_uri`, the browser stays on the login page, and the user can retry.
- **Server-side errors during direct_post** (revoked credential, invalid signature, etc.): The endpoint returns a JSON `{"redirect_uri": "/endpoint?error=...&error_description=..."}`. The wallet redirects the browser to this URL. The GET handler (`handleGet`) renders the Keycloak error page via `callback.error()`.

## Configuration Notes

- `trustedAuthoritiesMode` is explicit verifier policy. `none` is the default, `etsi_tl` adds the trust-list URL to DCQL, and `aki` adds extension-derived certificate key identifiers from the trust list.
- If `trustListLoTEType` is configured, the fetched trust list must match this `LoTEType`, which keeps one OID4VP IdP instance bound to one trust domain. If it is empty, all LoTE types are accepted and a warning is logged.
- Within an accepted trust list, issuer verification uses certificates from `.../SvcType/.../Issuance` services only, while status-list verification uses `.../SvcType/.../Revocation` services only.
- Each returned credential must match the format and type constraints on its own DCQL query ID.
- If `trustListSigningCertPem` is not configured, the trust-list JWT signature is not verified and the fetched trust list is trusted as-is. The code warns about that configuration but does not fail startup.
- When HAIP is enabled with `x509_hash`, the configured verifier certificate PEM is used for client ID derivation and request-object signing metadata. A full CA-issued chain is validated when present; a single non-self-signed leaf is also accepted, in which case issuer trust is expected to come from configured trust lists.

## DID issuer resolution

When `didResolutionEnabled` is enabled and the SD-JWT issuer is a DID, `SdJwtVerifier` requires resolution through an explicitly allowed `did:web` or `did:webvh` method. Successful resolution supplies signature verification keys; it does not skip SD-JWT signature, lifetime, disclosure, or holder-binding checks. The callback applies the configured issuer policy to every SD-JWT credential.

Resolution failure, a disallowed/unsupported method, or an empty key set rejects verification without certificate/metadata fallback. `did:webvh` also rejects when DID resolution is disabled. Its resolver validates the history and witnesses, then selects current authorized assertion keys by `kid`. See [WebVH validation](did-webvh.md) and [did:web compatibility limitations](configuration.md#didweb-issuer-verification).
